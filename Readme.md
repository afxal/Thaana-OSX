# Thaana Starter pack for OSX

This package is meant to help new users on OSX install a basic Dhivehi/Thaana package onto their system with minimal fuss. Everybody knows how new users to OSX love to harass the poor tech fellows to help them install these things.

This should help ease some of the pain, or so I hope.
